# Project Wizard

The Project Wizard is a command-line tool that helps you quickly create a new project using your favorite framework. It asks you a series of questions to determine which type of project you want to create (frontend or backend) and which framework you want to use, and then creates a new project folder and installs the necessary packages.

## Features

- Allows you to select popular packages to install for each framework
- Prints helpful messages about each framework after project creation
